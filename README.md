# Arduino-Synthesizer
Files for the 8-bit Arduino Audio Synthesizer

This is a polyphonic, 8-bit arduino synthesizer. Because the arduino uno does not have a digital to analog converter, we utilize an AD73028 IC to produce 8-bit waveforms, controlled by 7 buttons to produce 7 different notes, which can be played at the same time.
